<h1>Learning C++</h1><h3>posted on 12/05/15</h3>
    <p >I learnt about this fabulous language in my 12th standard as it was a part of my curriculum.But the knowledge I gained there was very basic.Now i am learning this programming language in somewhat deep.</p>
    <p>The C++ which i studied earlier was outdated. So I decided to learn C++ 11.
    I learnt about the new and additional features of C++ and its advantages over C.I made a clear understanding of classes and objects and also learnt about the &lsaquo;graphics.h&rsaquo;</p>
    <p>Now I am planning to improve my programming skills. For that I have started work on algorithms and making efficient programmes.</p>
